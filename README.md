This is a simple crawler mirroring publicly available papercraft models from [Cubeecraft](https://www.cubeecraft.com/) to a local folder.

I've written it to learn about [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/).

Run it using ```scrapy crawl cubeecraft```.

See ```FILES_STORE``` in ```cubeecraft_crawler/settings.py``` for download location.
